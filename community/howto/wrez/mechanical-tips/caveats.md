# Caveats

## By a beginner and for beginners

I still consider myself a beginner at 3D printing, not an expert. I
did, however, receive a EE degree in the early eighties and have spent a lifetime
making and rebuilding machines of all sorts (from guitars and ukuleles to heavy
precision machine tools). I was an absolute expert at making dust, chips,
swarf, and other debris from every material imaginable even before I discovered
the joys of smearing molten ABS plastic over a heated bed.

This guide intentionally assumes very little from the reader. I'd 
rather risk annoying advanced readers with "obvious" details than to assume
knowledge another beginner might not possess.

## Voron0 model-specific

To prevent bogging down in "if-this-then-that," this guide focuses on the
Voron0 printer model primarily (not least because I've built two so far, but
also because it is mechanically simple with no probe and only a single
leadscrew). The information applies equally well to other Voron models,
however (or any FDM printer, for that matter).  Even printers
with fancy bed probes, flying gantries, and hot-rodded tool-heads
will benefit from what's written here.

## Opinionated documentation

This guide proudly borrows a concept from software development: this is
_opinionated_ documentation. Instead of laboring through a zillion different
options and weighing the pros and cons of each, it describes what
works well for me. Of course there are other, possibly even better, ways
to do things. You are, of course, free to disagree and deviate from anything
written here. It's okay to be _wrong_. (Grin.)

Kidding aside, these tips indisputably **work**. Deviate with care.
