# Mechanical tips

## AKA: A Machinist's Guide to building and troubleshooting a 3D Printer

This guide intends to assist anyone building a 3D printer who wants to ensure
that it's assembled as accurately as possible.

Many printing problems trace back to purely mechanical issues (versus slicer
or printer configuration settings). It pays to get the mechanics right as you
are building a printer, but the information in this guide is equally useful for
troubleshooting an existing machine.

Fair warning about the information herein: While I know a bit about many things,
it may be worth reviewing the [caveats](#Caveats) at the end of this document
before taking anything I say here as gospel.
